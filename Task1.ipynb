A magazine or book containing lurid\\nsubject matter and being characteristically\\nprinted on rough, unfinished paper.\\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nA normal Denny\\'s, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It\\'s\\nabout 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn\\'t jammed, there\\'s a\\nhealthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and\\neating eggs.\\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young\\nMan has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow\\ncountryman, smokes cigarettes like they\\'re going out of style.\\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old\\nshe is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy\\nand girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid-\\npace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nNo, forget it, it\\'s too risky. I\\'m through\\ndoin\\' that shit.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou always say that, the same thing every\\ntime: never again, I\\'m through, too\\ndangerous.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI know that\\'s what I always say. I\\'m\\nalways right too, but –\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\n– but you forget about it in a day or two\\n–\\nYOUNG MAN\\n– yeah, well, the days of me forgittin\\'\\nare over, and the days of me rememberin\\'\\nhave just begun.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nWhen you go on like this, you know what\\nyou sound like?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI sound like a sensible fucking man, is\\nwhat I sound like.YOUNG WOMAN\\nYou sound like a duck.\\n(imitates a duck)\\nQuack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,\\nquack...\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWell take heart, \\'cause you\\'re never gonna\\nhafta hear it again. Because since I\\'m\\nnever gonna do it again, you\\'re never\\ngonna hafta hear me quack about how I\\'m\\nnever gonna do it again.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nAfter tonight.\\nThe boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there,\\nback and forth.\\nYOUNG MAN\\n(with a smile)\\nCorrect. I got all tonight to quack.\\nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\\nWAITRESS\\nCan I get anybody anymore coffee?\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nOh yes, thank you.\\nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman\\'s coffee. The Young Man lights\\nup another cigarette.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI\\'m doin\\' fine.\\nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke.\\nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.\\nThe Young Man goes right back into it.\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI mean the way it is now, you\\'re takin\\'\\nthe same fuckin\\' risk as when you rob a\\nbank. You take more of a risk. Banks are\\neasier! Federal banks aren\\'t supposed to\\nstop you anyway, during a robbery. They\\'re\\ninsured, why should they care? You don\\'t\\neven need a gun in a federal bank. I heard\\nabout this guy, walked into a federal bank\\nwith a portable phone, handed the phone to\\nthe teller, the guy on the other end of\\nthe phone said: \"We got this guy\\'s little\\ngirl, and if you don\\'t give him all your\\nmoney, we\\'re gonna kill \\'er.\"\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nDid it work?YOUNG MAN\\nFuckin\\' A it worked, that\\'s what I\\'m\\ntalkin\\' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank\\nwith a telephone, not a pistol, not a\\nshotgun, but a fuckin\\' phone, cleans the\\nplace out, and they don\\'t lift a fuckin\\'\\nfinger.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nDid they hurt the little girl?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI don\\'t know. There probably never was a\\nlittle girl – the point of the story isn\\'t\\nthe little girl. The point of the story is\\nthey robbed the bank with a telephone.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nYou wanna rob banks?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nI\\'m not sayin\\' I wanna rob banks, I\\'m just\\nillustrating that if we did, it would be\\neasier than what we been doin\\'.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nSo you don\\'t want to be a bank robber?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nNaw, all those guys are goin\\' down the\\nsame road, either dead or servin\\' twenty.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\nAnd no more liquor stores?\\nYOUNG MAN\\nWhat have we been talking about? Yeah, no-\\nmore-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain\\'t the\\ngiggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own\\nliquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they\\ncan\\'t fuckin\\' speak English. You tell \\'em:\\n\"Empty out the register,\" and they don\\'t\\nknow what it fuckin\\' means. They make it\\ntoo personal.

They\\'re not expecting to get robbed,\\nor not as expecting.\\nYOUNG WOMAN\\n(taking to idea)\\nI bet in places like this you couldcut\\ndown on the hero factor.YOUNG MAN\\nCorrect. Just like banks, these places are\\ninsured. The managers don\\'t give a fuck,\\nthey\\'re just tryin\\' to get ya out the door\\nbefore you start pluggin\\' diners.\\nWaitresses, forget it, they ain\\'t takin\\' a\\nbullet for the register. Busboys, some\\nwetback gettin\\' paid a dollar fifty a hour\\ngonna really give a fuck you\\'re stealin\\'\\nfrom the owner.

It\\'s legal to carry it,\\nwhich doesn\\'t really matter \\'cause – get a\\nload of this – if the cops stop you, it\\'s\\nillegal for this to search you.

And they show that one show to\\nthe people who pick the shows, and on the\\nstrength of that one show, they decide if\\nthey want to make more shows.

They don\\'t use that when\\nthey pierce your nipples, do they?\\nJODY\\nForget that gun. That gun goes against the\\nentire idea behind piercing.

JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT\\nIn the past six years, 50\\'s diners have sprung up all over L.A.,\\ngiving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They\\'re all\\nbasically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book, Golden\\nOldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy\\nwaitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino\\nCheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelette, and over prices that\\npay for all this bullshit.\\nBut then there\\'s JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S, the big mama of 50\\'s diners.\\nEither the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.Vincent\\'s Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a\\nneon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red\\nwindbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon\\nis the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S. Underneath that is the\\nslogan:\"Next best thing to a time machine.\"\\nVINCENT\\nWhat the fuck is this place?\\nMIA\\nThis is Jackrabbit Slim\\'s. An Elvis man\\nshould love it.\\nVINCENT\\nCome on, Mia, let\\'s go get a steak.\\nMIA\\nYou can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don\\'t\\nbe a...\\nMia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on the\\nscreen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.\\nVINCENT\\nAfter you, kitty-cat.\\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM\\'S – NIGHT\\nCompared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint\\nEnglish pub. Posters from 50\\'s A.I.P. movies are all over the wall\\n(\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF THE CRAB\\nMONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that the patrons\\nsit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.\\nIn the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on\\nthe wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\"So wannabe beboppers (actually\\nMelrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.\\nThe picture windows don\\'t look out the street, but instead, B & W\\nmovies of 50\\'s street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and\\nWAITERS are made up as replicas of 50\\'s icons: MARILYN MONROE,\\nZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP\\nMORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.\\nVincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red \\'59\\nEdsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big\\nbutton on his chest that says:\"Hi I\\'m Buddy, pleasing you please\\nme.\"\\nBUDDY\\nHi I\\'m Buddy, what can I get\\'cha?\\nVINCENT\\nI\\'ll have the Douglas Sirk steak.\\nBUDDY\\nHow d\\'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or\\nbloody as hell?VINCENT\\nBloody as hell.

The YUPPIES are dancing,\\nthe DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and the icons\\nare playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, The Midget is\\npaging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her customers drink\\ntheir milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a fool.\\nMIA\\nWhaddya think?\\nVINCENT\\nIt\\'s like a wax museum with a pulse rate.Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself\\na smoke.\\nAfter a second of watching him –\\nMIA\\nWhat are you doing?\\nVINCENT\\nRollin\\' a smoke.\\nMIA\\nHere?\\nVINCENT\\nIt\\'s just tobacco.\\nMIA\\nOh. Well in that case, will you roll me\\none, cowboy?\\nAs he finishes licking it –\\nVINCENT\\nYou can have his one, cowgirl.\\nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her\\nlips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent\\'s hand. He\\nlights it.\\nMIA\\nThanks.\\nVINCENT\\nThink nothing of it.\\nHe begins rolling one for himself.\\nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making\\neverything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent\\nin the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her\\nwhite dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire\\nrestaurant applauds.\\nBack to Mia and Vincent.\\nMIA\\nMarsellus said you just got back from\\nAmsterdam.\\nVINCENT\\nSure did. I heard you did a pilot.\\nMIA\\nThat was my fifteen minutes.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat was it?MIA\\nIt was show about a team of female secret\\nagents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\\nVINCENT\\nWhat?\\nMIA\\n\"Fox Force Five.\"Fox, as in we\\'re a bunch\\nof foxy chicks. Force, as in we\\'re a force\\nto be reckoned with. Five, as in there\\'s\\none... two ... three... four... five of\\nus. There was a blonde one, Sommerset\\nO\\'Neal from that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she\\nwas the leader. A Japanese one, a black\\none, a French one and a brunette one, me.\\nWe all had special skills. Sommerset had a\\nphotographic memory, the Japanese fox was\\na kung fu master, the black girl was a\\ndemolition expert, the French fox\\'\\nspecialty was sex...\\nVINCENT\\nWhat was your specialty?\\nMIA\\nKnives. The character I played, Raven\\nMcCoy, her background was she was raised\\nby circus performers. So she grew up doing\\na knife act. According to the show, she\\nwas the deadliest woman in the world with\\na knife. But because she grew up in a\\ncircus, she was also something of an\\nacrobat. She could do illusions, she was a\\ntrapeze artist – when you\\'re keeping the\\nworld safe from evil, you never know when\\nbeing a trapeze artist\\'s gonna come in\\nhandy. And she knew a zillion old jokes\\nher grandfather, an old vaudevillian,\\ntaught her. If we woulda got picked up,\\nthey woulda worked in a gimmick where\\nevery episode I woulda told and ol joke.\\nVINCENT\\nDo you remember any of the jokes?\\nMIA\\nWell I only got the chance to say one,\\n\\'cause we only did one show.\\nVINCENT\\nTell me.\\nMIA\\nNo. It\\'s really corny.\\nVINCENT\\nC\\'mon, don\\'t be that way.MIA\\nNo. You won\\'t like it and I\\'ll be\\nembarrassed.\\nVINCENT\\nYou told it in front of fifty million\\npeople and you can\\'t tell it to me? I\\npromise I won\\'t laugh.\\nMIA\\n(laughing)\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m afraid of.\\nVINCENT\\nThat\\'s not what I meant and you know it.\\nMIA\\nYou\\'re quite the silver tongue devil,\\naren\\'t you?\\nVINCENT\\nI meant I wouldn\\'t laugh at you.\\nMIA\\nThat\\'s not what you said Vince. Well now\\nI\\'m definitely not gonna tell ya, \\'cause\\nit\\'s been built up too much.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat a gyp.\\nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the\\nstraw of her shake.\\nMIA\\nYummy!\\nVINCENT\\nCan I have a sip of that? I\\'d like to know\\nwhat a five-dollar shake tastes like.\\nMIA\\nBe my guest.\\nShe slides the shake over to him.\\nMIA\\nYou can use my straw, I don\\'t have\\nkooties.\\nVincent smiles.\\nVINCENT\\nYeah, but maybe I do.\\nMIA\\nKooties I can handle.\\nHe takes a sip.VINCENT\\n Goddamn! That\\'s a pretty fuckin\\' good\\nmilk shake.\\nMIA\\nTold ya.\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s worth five dollars,\\nbut it\\'s pretty fuckin\\'  good.\\nHe slides the shake back.\\nThen the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.\\nMIA\\nDon\\'t you hate that?\\nVINCENT\\nWhat?\\nMIA\\nUncomfortable silences. Why do we feel\\nit\\'s necessary to yak about bullshit in\\norder to be comfortable?\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t know.\\nMIA\\nThat\\'s when you know you found somebody\\nspecial.

But don\\'t\\nfeel bad, we just met each other.\\nMIA\\nWell I\\'ll tell you what, I\\'ll go to the\\nbathroom and powder my nose, while you sit\\nhere and think of something to say.\\nVINCENT\\nI\\'ll do that.\\nINT.

I don\\'t\\nsee Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her\\nnight off.\\nMIA\\nPretty smart.\\nVINCENT\\nI have moments.\\nMIA\\nDid ya think of something to say?\\nVINCENT\\nActually, there\\'s something I\\'ve wanted to\\nask you about, but you seem like a nice\\nperson, and I didn\\'t want to offend you.\\nMIA\\nOooohhhh, this doesn\\'t sound like\\nmindless, boring, getting-to-know-you\\nchit-chat. This sounds like you actually\\nhave something to say.\\nVINCENT\\nOnly if you promise not to get offended.MIA\\nYou can\\'t promise something like that. I\\nhave no idea what you\\'re gonna ask. You\\ncould ask me what you\\'re gonna ask me, and\\nmy natural response could be to be\\noffended. Then, through no fault of my\\nown, I woulda broken my promise.\\nVINCENT\\nThen let\\'s just forget it.\\nMIA\\nThat is an impossibility. Trying to forget\\nanything as intriguing as this would be an\\nexercise in futility.\\nVINCENT\\nIs that a fact?\\nMia nods her head: \"Yes.\"\\nMIA\\nBesides, it\\'s more exciting when you don\\'t\\nhave permission.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat do you think about what happened to\\nAntwan?\\nMIA\\nWho\\'s Antwan?\\nVINCENT\\nTony Rocky Horror.\\nMIA\\nHe fell out of a window.\\nVINCENT\\nThat\\'s one way to say it.

But that doesn\\'t\\nmean it didn\\'t happen. I heard Marsellus\\nis very protective of you.\\nMIA\\nA husband being protective of his wife is\\none thing. A husband almost killing\\nanother man for touching his wife\\'s feet\\nis something else.\\nVINCENT\\nBut did it happen?MIA\\nThe only thing Antwan ever touched of mine\\nwas my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan\\nonce – at my wedding – then never again.\\nThe truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus\\ntossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that\\nwindow except Marsellus and Tony Rocky\\nHorror.

She touches its sleeve. It feels good.\\nHer hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like\\na little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some\\nrolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and\\nrolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but\\nnot bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches\\nback in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the\\nlighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince\\ndid. What do you know, she did it! Mia\\'s one happy clam. She\\ntriumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it\\nup, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\\nThe Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a\\nlong, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat\\npocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers\\nbring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that\\nVincent bought earlier from Lance.

But she\\'s\\ngot a breast plate in front of her heart,\\nso you gotta pierce through that.

BUTCH\\'S MOTHER, 35ish,\\nstands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to her is\\na man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The\\nCAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old boy.MOTHER\\nButch, stop watching TV a second. We got a\\nspecial visitor. Now do you remember when\\nI told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W.\\ncamp?\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nUh-huh.\\nMOTHER\\nWell this here is Capt. Koons. He was in\\nthe P.O.W. camp with Daddy.\\nCAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends\\ndown on one knee to bring him even  ith the boy\\'s eyeline. When\\nKoons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas accent.\\nCAPT. KOONS\\nHello, little man. Boy I sure heard a\\nbunch about you. See, I was a good friend\\nof your Daddy\\'s. We were in that Hanoi pit\\nof hell over five years together.\\nHopefully, you\\'ll never have to experience\\nthis yourself, but when two men are in a\\nsituation like me and your Daddy were, for\\nas long as we were, you take on certain\\nresponsibilities of the other. If it had\\nbeen me who had not made it, Major\\nCoolidge would be talkin\\' right now to my\\nson Jim. But the way it worked out is I\\'m\\ntalkin\\' to you, Butch. I got somethin\\' for\\nya.\\nThe Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.\\nCAPT. KOONS\\nThis watch I got here was first purchased\\nby your great-granddaddy. It was bought\\nduring the First World War in a little\\ngeneral store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It\\nwas bought by private Doughboy Ernie\\nCoolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It\\nwas your great-granddaddy\\'s war watch,\\nmade by the first company to ever make\\nwrist watches. You see, up until then,\\npeople just carried pocket watches. Your\\ngreat-granddaddy wore that watch every day\\nhe was in the war. Then when he had done\\nhis duty, he went home to your great-\\ngrandmother, took the watch off his wrist\\nand put it in an ol\\' coffee can. And in\\nthat can it stayed \\'til your grandfather\\nDane Coolidge was called upon by his\\ncountry to go overseas and fight the\\nGermans once again. This time they called\\nit World War Two. Your great-granddaddy\\ngave it to your granddad for good luck.\\nUnfortunately, Dane\\'s luck wasn\\'t as good\\nas his old man\\'s. Your granddad was a\\n(MORE)CAPT. KOONS (CONT\\'D)\\nMarine and he was killed with all the\\nother Marines at the battle of Wake\\nIsland. Your granddad was facing death and\\nhe knew it. None of those boys had any\\nillusions about ever leavin\\' that island\\nalive. So three days before the Japanese\\ntook the island, your 22-year old\\ngrandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force\\ntransport named Winocki, a man he had\\nnever met before in his life, to deliver\\nto his infant son, who he had never seen\\nin the flesh, his gold watch. Three days\\nlater, your grandfather was dead. But\\nWinocki kept his word. After the war was\\nover, he paid a visit to your grandmother,\\ndelivering to your infant father, his\\nDad\\'s gold watch. This watch. This watch\\nwas on your Daddy\\'s wrist when he was shot\\ndown over Hanoi. He was captured and put\\nin a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew\\nif the gooks ever saw the watch it\\'s be\\nconfiscated. The way your Daddy looked at\\nit, that watch was your birthright. And\\nhe\\'d be damned if and slopeheads were\\ngonna put their greasy yella hands on his\\nboy\\'s birthright. So he hid it in the one\\nplace he knew he could hide somethin\\'. His\\nass. Five long years, he wore this watch\\nup his ass. Then when he died of\\ndisentary, he gave me the watch. I hid\\nwith uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass\\nfor two years. Then, after seven years, I\\nwas sent home to my family. And now,\\nlittle man, I give the watch to you.\\nCapt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes into\\nFRAME to accept it.\\nCUT TO:\\nINT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT\\nThe 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:\\ntrunks, shoes and gloves.

Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his\\nsweaty face with his boxing glove.\\nHis trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a little,\\nsticking his head in the room.

He\\nleans in the driver\\'s side window.\\nESMARELDA\\nForty-five sixty.\\nHanding her the money.\\nBUTCH\\nMerci beaucoup. And here\\'s a little\\nsomething for the effort.\\nButch holds up a hundred dollar bill.\\nEsmarelda\\'s eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it out\\nof reach.\\nBUTCH\\nNow if anybody should ask you about who\\nyour fare was tonight, what\\'re you gonna\\ntell \\'em?\\nESMARELDA\\nThe truth. Three well-dressed, slightly\\ntoasted, Mexicans.\\nHe gives her the bill.\\nBUTCH\\nBon soir, Esmarelda.\\nESMARELDA\\n(in Spanish)\\nSleep well, Butch.\\nHe tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. She\\ndrives off.\\nINT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT\\nButch enters and turns on the light.\\nLying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us is\\nButch\\'s French girlfriend, FABIENNE.\\nFABIENNE\\nKeep the light off.\\nButch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.\\nBUTCH\\nIs that better, sugar pop?FABIENNE\\nOui. Hard day at the office?\\nBUTCH\\nPretty hard. I got into a fight.\\nFABIENNE\\nPoor baby. Can we make spoons?\\nButch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.\\nWhen Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in baby-\\ntalk.\\nFABIENNE\\nI was looking at myself in the mirror.\\nBUTCH\\nUh-huh?\\nFABIENNE\\nI wish I had a pot.\\nBUTCH\\nYou were lookin\\' in the mirror and you\\nwish you had some pot?\\nFABIENNE\\nA pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.\\nBUTCH\\nWell you should be happy, \\'cause you do.\\nFABIENNE\\nShut up, Fatso! I don\\'t have a pot! I have\\na bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she\\ndid \"Lucky Star,\" it\\'s not the same thing.\\nBUTCH\\nI didn\\'t realize there was a difference\\nbetween a tummy and a pot belly.\\nFABIENNE\\nThe difference is huge.\\nBUTCH\\nYou want me to have a pot?\\nFABIENNE\\nNo. Pot bellies make a man look either\\noafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman,\\na pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you\\nis normal. Normal face, normal legs,\\nnormal hips, normal ass, but with a big,\\nperfectly round pot belly. If I had one,\\nI\\'d wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small\\nto accentuate it.\\nBUTCH\\nYou think guys would find that attractive?FABIENNE\\nI don\\'t give a damn what men find\\nattractive. It\\'s unfortunate what we find\\npleasing to the touch and pleasing to the\\neye is seldom the same.\\nBUTCH\\nIf I had a pot belly, I\\'d punch you in it.\\nFABIENNE\\nYou\\'d punch me in my belly?\\nBUTCH\\nRight in the belly.\\nFABIENNE\\nI\\'d smother you. I\\'d drop it on your right\\non your face \\'til you couldn\\'t breathe.\\nBUTCH\\nYou\\'d do that to me?\\nFABIENNE\\nYes!\\nBUTCH\\nDid you get everything, sugar pop?\\nFABIENNE\\nYes, I did.\\nBUTCH\\nGood job.\\nFABIENNE\\nDid everything go as planned?\\nBUTCH\\nYou didn\\'t listen to the radio?\\nFABIENNE\\nI never listen to your fights. Were you\\nthe winner?\\nBUTCH\\nI won alright.\\nFABIENNE\\nAre you still retiring?\\nBUTCH\\nSure am.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat about the man you fought?\\nBUTCH\\nFloyd retired too.FABIENNE\\n(smiling)\\nReally?! He won\\'t be fighting no more?!\\nBUTCH\\nNot no more.\\nFABIENNE\\nSo it all worked out in the finish?\\nBUTCH\\nWe ain\\'t at the finish, baby.\\nFabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.\\nFABIENNE\\nWe\\'re in a lot of danger, aren\\'t we?\\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nIf they find us, they\\'ll kill us, won\\'t\\nthey?\\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nBut they won\\'t find us, will they?\\nButch nods his head: \"no.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nDo you still want me to go with you?\\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nI don\\'t want to be a burden or a nuisance\\n–\\nButch\\'s hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch.\\nFabienne reacts.\\nFABIENNE\\nSay it!\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, I want you to be with me.\\nFABIENNE\\nForever?\\nBUTCH\\n... and ever.\\nFabienne lies her head back.\\nButch continues to massage her crotch.FABIENNE\\nDo you love me?\\nBUTCH\\nOui.\\nFABIENNE\\nButch? Will you give me oral pleasure?\\nButch kisses her on the mouth.\\nBUTCH\\nWill you kiss it?\\nShe nods her head: \"yes.\"\\nFABIENNE\\nBut you first.\\nButch\\'s head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral\\npleasure. Fabienne\\'s face is alone in the frame.\\nFABIENNE\\n(in French, with English\\nsubtitles)\\nButch my love, the adventure begins.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:\\nMOTEL ROOM\\nSame motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in the\\nbathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We see\\nFabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up.\\nShe\\'s drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower\\nwashing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky\\nglass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns\\nthe shower off and opens the door, popping his head out.\\nBUTCH\\nI think I cracked a rib.\\nFABIENNE\\nGiving me oral pleasure?\\nBUTCH\\nNo retard, from the fight.\\nFABIENNE\\nDon\\'t call me retard.\\nBUTCH\\n(in a Mongoloid voice)\\nMy name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!FABIENNE\\nShut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid\\nvoice.\\nBUTCH\\nOkay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back!\\nCan I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful\\nTulip.\\nFABIENNE\\nOh I like that, I like being called a\\ntulip. Tulip is much better than\\nMongoloid.\\nShe finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on\\nher head.\\nBUTCH\\nI didn\\'t call you a Mongoloid, I called\\nyou a retard, but I took it back.\\nShe hands him a towel.\\nBUTCH\\nMerci beaucoup.\\nFABIENNE\\nButch?\\nBUTCH\\n(drying his head)\\nYes, lemon pie.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhere are we going to go?\\nBUTCH\\nI\\'m not sure yet. Wherever you want. We\\'re\\ngonna get a lot of money from this. But it\\nain\\'t gonna be so much, we can live like\\nhogs in the fat house forever. I was\\nthinking we could go somewhere in the\\nSouth Pacific. The kinda money we\\'ll\\nhave\\'ll carry us a long way down there.\\nFABIENNE\\nSo if we wanted, we could live in Bora\\nBora?\\nBUTCH\\nYou betcha. And if after awhile you don\\'t\\ndig Bora Bora, then we can move over to\\nTahiti or Mexico.\\nFABIENNE\\nBut I do not speak Spanish.BUTCH\\nYou don\\'t speak Bora Boran either.\\nBesides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el\\nzapataria?\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat does that mean?\\nBUTCH\\nWhere\\'s the shoe store?\\nFABIENNE\\nDonde esta el zapataria?\\nBUTCH\\nExcellent pronunciation. You\\'ll be my\\nlittle mama ceta in no time.\\nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her\\nteeth.\\nButch keeps on from the other room.\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nQue hora es?\\nFABIENNE\\nQue hora es?\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nWhat time is it?\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat time is it?\\nBUTCH (O.S.)\\nTime for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.\\nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then\\nshe remember something.\\nFABIENNE\\nButch.\\nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to\\nfind him sound asleep in bed.\\nShe looks at him for a moment.\\nFABIENNE\\nForget it.\\nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE\\nSHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:MOTEL ROOM – MORNING\\nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep\\nin bed.\\nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so\\nshe can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth\\nrobe from the night before.\\nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL\\'S ANGELS are taking on\\nthe entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\".\\nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him.\\nHis start startles Fabienne.\\nFABIENNE\\nMerde! You startled me. Did you have a bad\\ndream?\\nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus.\\nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell\\'s\\nAngels tear-assin\\' through a Vietnamese prison camp.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat are you watching?\\nFABIENNE\\nA motorcycle movie, I\\'m not sure the name.\\nBUTCH\\nAre you watchin\\' it?\\nFabienne enters the room.\\nFABIENNE\\nIn a way. Why? Would you like for me to\\nswitch it off?\\nBUTCH\\nWould you please?\\nShe reaches over and turns off the TV.\\nBUTCH\\nIt\\'s a little too early in the morning for\\nexplosions and war.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhat was it about?\\nBUTCH\\nHow should I know, you were the one\\nwatchin\\' it.\\nFabienne laughs.\\nFABIENNE\\nNo, imbecile, what was your dream about?BUTCH\\nOh, I... don\\'t remember. It\\'s really rare\\nI remember a dream.\\nFABIENNE\\nYou just woke up from it.\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, I\\'m not lying to you, I don\\'t\\nremember.\\nFABIENNE\\nWell, let\\'s look at the grumpy man in the\\nmorning. I didn\\'t say you were lying, it\\'s\\njust odd you don\\'t remember your dreams. I\\nalways remember mine. Did you know you\\ntalk in your sleep?\\nBUTCH\\nI don\\'t talk in my sleep, do I talk in my\\nsleep?\\nFABIENNE\\nYou did last night.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat did I say?\\nLaying on top of him.\\nFABIENNE\\nI don\\'t know. I couldn\\'t understand you.\\nShe kisses Butch.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhy don\\'t you get up and we\\'ll get some\\nbreakfast at that breakfast place with the\\npancakes.\\nBUTCH\\nOne more kiss and I\\'ll get up.\\nFabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.\\nFABIENNE\\nSatisfied?\\nBUTCH\\nYep.\\nFABIENNE\\nThen get up, lazy bones.\\nButch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the\\nsuitcase that Fabienne brought.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat time is it?FABIENNE\\nAlmost nine in the morning. What time does\\nour train arrive?\\nBUTCH\\nEleven.\\nFABIENNE\\nI\\'m gonna order a big plate of blueberry\\npancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy,\\nand five sausages.\\nBUTCH\\n(surprised at her potential appetite)\\nAnything to drink with that?\\nButch is finished dressing.\\nFABIENNE\\n(referring to his clothes)\\nOh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall\\nglass or orange juice and a black cup of\\ncoffee. After that, I\\'m going to have a\\nslice of pie.\\nAs he goes through the suitcase.\\nBUTCH\\nPie for breakfast?\\nFABIENNE\\nAny time of the day is a good time for\\npie. Blueberry pie to go with the\\npancakes. And on top, a thin slice of\\nmelted cheese –\\nBUTCH\\n– where\\'s my watch?\\nFABIENNE\\nIt\\'s there.\\nBUTCH\\nNo, it\\'s not. It\\'s not here.\\nFABIENNE\\nHave you looked?\\nBy now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.\\nBUTCH\\nYes I\\'ve fuckin\\' looked!!\\nHe\\'s now throwing clothes.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat the fuck do you think I\\'m doing?! Are\\nyou sure you got it?\\nFabienne can hardly speak, she\\'s never seen Butch this way.FABIENNE\\nUhhh... yes... beside the table drawer –\\nBUTCH\\n– on the little kangaroo.\\nFABIENNE\\nYes, it was on your little kangaroo.\\nBUTCH\\nWell it\\'s not here!\\nFABIENNE\\n(on the verge of tears)\\nWell it should be!\\nBUTCH\\nOh it most definitely should be here, but\\nit\\'s not. So where is it?\\nFabienne is crying and scared.\\nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more\\nmenacing.\\nBUTCH\\nFabienne, that was my father\\'s fuckin\\'\\nwatch. You know what my father went\\nthrough to git me that watch?... I don\\'t\\nwanna get into it right now... but he went\\nthrough a lot. Now all this other shit,\\nyou coulda set on fire, but I specifically\\nreminded you not to forget my father\\'s\\nwatch. Now think, did you get it?\\nFABIENNE\\nI believe so...\\nBUTCH\\nYou believe so? You either did, or you\\ndidn\\'t, now which one is it?\\nFABIENNE\\nThen I did.\\nBUTCH\\nAre you sure?\\nFABIENNE\\n(shaking)\\nNo.\\nButch freaks out, he punches the air.\\nFabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner,\\nButch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.\\nFabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.\\nBUTCH\\n(to Fabienne)\\nNo! It\\'s not your fault.\\n(he approached her)\\nYou left it at the apartment.\\nHe bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.\\nHe touches her hand, she flinches.\\nBUTCH\\nIf you did leave it at the apartment, it\\'s\\nnot your fault. I had you bring a bunch of\\nstuff. I reminded you about it, but I\\ndidn\\'t illustrate how personal the watch\\nwas to me. If all I gave a fuck about was\\nmy watch, I should\\'ve told you. You ain\\'t\\na mind reader.\\nHe kisses her hand. Then rises.\\nFabienne is still sniffling.\\nButch goes to the closet.\\nFABIENNE\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nButch puts on his high school jacket.\\nBUTCH\\nDon\\'t be. It just means I won\\'t be able to\\neat breakfast with you.\\nFABIENNE\\nWhy does it mean that?\\nBUTCH\\nBecause I\\'m going back to my apartment to\\nget my watch.\\nFABIENNE\\nWon\\'t the gangsters be looking for you\\nthere?\\nBUTCH\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m gonna find out. If they\\nare, and I don\\'t think I can handle it,\\nI\\'ll split.\\nRising from the floor.\\nFABIENNE\\nI was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I\\nthought I brought it. I\\'m so sorry.\\nButch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.BUTCH\\nDon\\'t feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you\\ncould ever do would make me permanently\\nangry at you.\\n(pause)\\nI love you, remember?\\n(he digs some money out of\\nhis wallet)\\nNow here\\'s some money, order those\\npancakes and have a great breakfast.\\nFABIENNE\\nDon\\'t go.\\nBUTCH\\nI\\'ll be back before you can say, blueberry\\npie.\\nFABIENNE\\nBlueberry pie.\\nBUTCH\\nWell maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?\\nOkay?\\nFABIENNE\\nOkay.\\nHe kisses her once more and heads for the door.\\nBUTCH\\nBye-bye, sugar pop.\\nFABIENNE\\nBye.\\nBUTCH\\nI\\'m gonna take your Honda.\\nFABIENNE\\nOkay.\\nAnd with that, he\\'s out the door.\\nFabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.\\nINT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY\\nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as\\nhe drives down the street.\\nBUTCH\\nOf all the fuckin\\' things she coulda\\nforgot, she forgets my father\\'s watch. I\\nspecifically reminded her not to forget\\nit. \"Bedside table – on the kangaroo.\" I\\nsaid the words: \"Don\\'t forget my father\\'s\\nwatch.\"EXT. CITY STREET – DAY\\nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little\\nengine will take it.\\nCUT TO:\\nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow\\npointing at one hour.\\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY\\nButch isn\\'t completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of\\nblocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes\\nboppin\\' through the front door.\\nEXT. ALLEY – DAY\\nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then\\nhe discreetly glances out.\\nEXT. STREET – BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT – DAY\\nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in\\nthe street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of\\nthem have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks\\nlike normal morning activity in front of Butch\\'s home.\\nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.\\nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses\\nthe street and enters his apartment courtyard.\\nAcross the street from Butch\\'s building, on the corner, is a\\ncombination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks\\nup in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a graphic of a\\ndonut sticking out of a bowl of rice.\\nEXT. BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY\\nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment\\nbuilding. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry\\nroom, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears disturbed.\\nButch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He\\nsteps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.\\nButch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.\\nINT. BUTCH\\'S APARTMENT – DAY\\nHis apartment hasn\\'t been touched.He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look\\naround. Obviously, no one is there.\\nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator.\\nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from\\nit.\\nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to\\nthe bedroom.\\nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean and\\nanonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing\\ntrophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of \"Ring\\nMagazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry\\nand one of George Chuvalo.\\nSure enough, there\\'s the watch just like he said it was: On the\\nbedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.\\nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens\\na cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the\\nmilk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in\\nthe toaster.\\nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\\nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a\\nhuge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\\nBUTCH\\n(softly)\\nHoly shit.\\nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponary and examines it.\\nThen... a toilet FLUSHES.\\nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the\\nkitchen. There is someone behind it.\\nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing\\nwhat to do.\\nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of  the\\nbathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book \"MODESTY\\nBLAISE\" by Peter O\\'Donnell.\\nVincent and Butch lock eyes.\\nVincent freezes.\\nButch doesn\\'t move, except to point the M61 in Vincent\\'s\\ndirection.\\nNeither man opens his mouth.\\nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.\\nThat\\'s all the situation needed.Butch\\'s finger HITS the trigger.\\nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.\\nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY –\\nLIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and\\nCRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.\\nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is\\nannihilated.\\nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes\\nfrom the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down\\nto the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\\nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back\\non the kitchen counter.\\nThen he exits the apartment, quickly.\\nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY\\nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the\\ncourtyard...\\n... comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...\\n... goes through the alley...\\n... and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.\\nEXT. HONDA – DAY\\nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile\\nof a survivor breaks across his face.\\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY\\nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment\\nbuilding.\\nINT. HONDA – DAY\\nButch looks out the window at his former home.\\nBUTCH\\nThat\\'s how you\\'re gonna beat \\'em, Butch.\\nThey keep underestimatin\\' ya.\\nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape\\nin the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with\\nit.\\nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the\\ncorner across from Teriyaki Donut.Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:\\nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\\nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,\\ncarrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of\\ncoffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of\\nButch\\'s car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.\\nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of\\nhim.\\nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch\\'s car, he casually glances to\\nhis left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!\\nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I\\'m seeing?\"\\nButch doesn\\'t wait for the big man to answer his own question. He\\nSTOMPS on the gas pedal.\\nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and\\nthe coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.\\nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro\\nZ-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on\\nthe sidewalk.\\nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one\\ntime was Fabienne\\'s Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The\\nstill-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes\\nhis head inside.\\nPEDESTRIAN\\nJesus, are you okay?\\nButch look at him, spaced-out.\\nBUTCH\\nI guess.\\nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather\\naround the body.\\nGAWKER #1\\n(to the others)\\nHe\\'s dead! He\\'s dead!\\nThis jerk\\'s yelling makes Marsellus come to.\\nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.\\nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.\\nGAWKER #2\\nIf you need a witness in court, I\\'ll be\\nglad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He\\nhit you and crashed into that car.MARSELLUS\\n(still incoherent)\\nWho?\\nGAWKER #2\\n(pointing at Butch)\\nHim.\\nMarsellus follows the Gawker\\'s finger and sees Butch Coolidge down\\nthe street, looking a shambles.\\nMARSELLUS\\nWell, I\\'ll be damned.\\nThe big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away.\\nMarsellus starts moving toward Butch.\\nButch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.\\nBUTCH\\nSacre bleu.\\nMarsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he\\'s so hurt, shaky\\nand dazed that his arm goes wild.\\nHe HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,\\nscreaming.\\nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN\\nOh my God, I\\'ve been shot!\\nThat\\'s all Butch needs to see. He\\'s outta here.\\nMarsellus RUNS after him.\\nThe CROWD looks agape.\\nButch is in a mad, limping RUN.\\nThe big man\\'s hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.\\nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign\\nthat reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\".\\nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin\\' boy, stands behind the counter of his\\npawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES\\ninto his world.\\nMAYNARD\\nCan I help you wit\\' somethin\\'?\\nBUTCH\\nShut up!\\nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to\\nthe door.MAYNARD\\nNow you just wait one goddamn minute –\\nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He\\ndoesn\\'t get past the doorway  because Butch LANDS his fist in\\nMarsellus\\' face.\\nThe gangster\\'s feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS\\nFLAT on his back.\\nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.\\nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the\\nface.\\nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus\\' hand, than grabs ahold of\\nhis middle finger.\\nBUTCH\\nSo you like chasing people, huh?\\nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.Butch then\\nplaces the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the\\nhammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the\\nsplatter.\\nBUTCH\\nWell guess what, big man, you caught me –\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\n– hold it right there, godammit!\\nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who\\'s brandishing a pump-\\naction shotgun, aimed at the two men.\\nBUTCH\\nLook mister, this ain\\'t any of your\\nbusiness –\\nMAYNARD\\n– I\\'m makin\\' it my business! Now toss that\\ngun!\\nButch does.\\nMAYNARD\\nNow you on top, stand up and come to the\\ncounter.\\nButch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets\\nthere, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the\\nbutt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.\\nAfter Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the\\ncounter and moves to the telephone.\\nMarsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily\\nwatches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the\\nline while the other end rings. Then it picks up.MAYNARD\\nZed? It\\'s Maynard. The spider just caught\\na coupl\\'a flies.\\nMarsellus passes out.\\nFADE TO BLACK\\nFADE UP:\\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY\\nTWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\\nThey are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two\\nS&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little\\nred ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious.\\nMaynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys\\nuntil they\\'re wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look\\nup at their captors.\\nMaynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand,\\nshotgun in the other, and Marsellus\\' .45 sticking in his belt.\\nMAYNARD\\nNobody kills anybody in my place of\\nbusiness except me or Zed.\\nA BUZZER buzzes.\\nMAYNARD\\nThat\\'s Zed.\\nWithout saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that\\nlead to red curtains and goes through them.\\nWE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside\\nthe store.\\nButch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the\\npawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their\\npredicament, Butxh and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of\\nhostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what\\nthey\\'ve gotten themselves into.\\nMaynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more\\nintense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two\\nhillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious\\npitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front\\nof the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:\\nZED\\n(to Maynard)\\nYou said you waited for me?\\nMAYNARD\\nI did.ZED\\nThen how come they\\'re all beat up?\\nMAYNARD\\nThey did that to each other. They was\\nfightin\\' when they came in.

There are zippers, buckles and studs here\\nand there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with\\ntwo eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in\\na hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.\\nZed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then\\nlowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp\\'s leash to Zed, then backs\\naway.\\nMAYNARD\\n(to The Gimp)\\nDown!The Gimp gets on its knees.\\nMaynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\\nMAYNARD\\nWho\\'s first?\\nZED\\nI ain\\'t fer sure yet.\\nThen with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany,\\nminey, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger\\ngoing back and forth between the two.\\nButch are Marsellus are terrified.\\nMaynard looks back and forth at the victims.\\nThe Gimps\\'s eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\\nZed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to\\nright, then it stops.\\nTWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\\nAfter a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on\\nMarsellus.\\nZed stands up.\\nZED\\nWanna do it here?\\nMAYNARD\\nNaw, drag big boy to Russell\\'s old room.\\nZed grabs Marsellus\\' chair and DRAGS him into Russell\\'s old room.\\nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the\\nmisfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever\\nhappened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his\\nold room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.\\nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he\\ndisappears behind the door of Russell\\'s old room.\\nMAYNARD\\n(to The Gimp)\\nUp!\\nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp\\'s leash to a hook on the\\nceiling.\\nMAYNARD\\nKeep an eye on this one.\\nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\"Maynard disappears into Russell\\'s\\nold room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The\\nJudds, singing in harmony, fills the air.Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask\\nas if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.\\nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\nWhoa, this boy\\'s got a bit of fight in\\n\\'em!\\nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\\nZED (O.S.)\\nYou wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I\\nlike to fight!\\nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly\\nstruggles to get free.\\nThe Gimp is laughing wildly.\\nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can\\'t break free.\\nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing\\nIn the back room, we hear:\\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\\nThat\\'s it... that\\'s it boy, you\\'re goin\\'\\nfine. Oooooooh, just like that... that\\'s\\ngood.\\n(grunting faster)\\nStay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed\\ngoddammit, git over here and hold \\'em!\\nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite\\neasily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were\\nnever connected by a bolt.\\nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\\nTHE GIMP\\nHuhng?\\nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He\\ntries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and\\ngrunts.\\nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER\\'S\\nPUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him\\nfall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to\\nthe hook,\\nButch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through\\nthe red curtains.INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY\\nButch sneaks to the door.\\nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to\\nthe ring. Grabbing them, he\\'s about to go out when he stops and\\nlistens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with\\nMarsellus.\\nButch decides for the life of him, he can\\'t leave anybody in a\\nsituation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for\\na weapon to bash those hillbillies\\' heads in with.\\nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it:\\nNot destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it\\nfor a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger\\nhe tries on for size. But then he spots what he\\'s been looking\\nfor:\\nA Samurai sword.\\nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall,\\nnext to a neon \"DAD\\'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign. Butch takes\\nthe sword off the wall, removing it from ist sheath. It\\'s a\\nmagnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage\\nlight of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see\\nif the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It\\'s as sharp as\\nit gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm\\ndownstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Ken-\\nstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of\\nbusiness.\\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY\\nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\\nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the\\nclosed door that leads to Russell\\'s old room.\\nINT.

It swings\\nopen silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions.\\nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse.\\nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\\nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind\\nhim with the sword.\\nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red\\nball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming\\nup behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\\nBUTCH\\nHey hillbilly.\\nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the\\nfront, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.\\nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\\nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword\\nbehind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the\\nblade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\\nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the\\ntip of Butch\\'s sword to Marsellus\\' .45 Automatic, which lies\\nwithin reach.\\nButch\\'s eyes follow Zed\\'s.\\nBUTCH\\nYou want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.\\nZed\\'s hand inches toward the weapon.\\nButch GRIPS the sword tighter.\\nZed studies Butch.\\nButch looks hard at Zed.\\nThen a VOICE says:\\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\\nStep aside, Butch.\\nButch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,\\nholding Maynard\\'s pump-action shotgun.\\nKABOOM!!!!\\nZed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\\nMarsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used\\nshotgun shell.\\nButch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\\nBUTCH\\nYou okay?\\nMARSELLUS\\nNaw man. I\\'m pretty fuckin\\' far from okay!\\nLong pause.\\nBUTCH\\nWhat now?MARSELLUS\\nWhat now?

May I come in?\\nJIMMIE\\nPlease do.\\nIn the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYou must be Jules, which would make you\\nVincent. Let\\'s get down to brass tacks,\\ngentlemen. If I was informed correctly,\\nthe clock is ticking, is that right,\\nJimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\n100%.\\nTHE WOLF\\nYour wife, Bonnie...\\n(refers to his pad)\\n... comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that\\ncorrect?\\nJIMMIE\\nUh-huh.\\nTHE WOLF\\nI was led to believe if she comes home and\\nfinds us here, she wouldn\\'t appreciate it\\nnone too much.\\nJIMMIE\\nShe won\\'t at that.THE WOLF\\nThat give use forty minutes to get the\\nfuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I\\nsay when I say it, should by plenty. Now\\nyou got a corpse in a car, minus a head,\\nin a garage. Take me to it.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S GARAGE – MORNING\\nThe three men hand back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies\\nthe car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, circling it.\\nTHE WOLF\\nJimmie?\\nJIMMIE\\nYes.\\nTHE WOLF\\nDo me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled\\nsome coffee in there. Would you make me a\\ncup?\\nJIMMIE\\nSure, how do you take it?\\nTHE WOLF\\nLotsa cream, lotsa sugar.\\nJimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.\\nTHE WOLF\\nAbout the car, is there anything I need to\\nknow? Does it stall, does it make a lot of\\nnoise, does it smoke, is there gas in it,\\nanything?\\nJULES\\nAside from how it looks, the car\\'s cool.\\nTHE WOLF\\nPositive? Don\\'t get me out on the road and\\nI find out the brake lights don\\'t work.\\nJULES\\nHey man, as far as I know, the\\nmotherfucker\\'s tip-top.\\nTHE WOLF\\nGood enough, let\\'s go back to the kitchen.\\nINT. KITCHEN – MORNING\\nJimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.\\nTHE WOLF\\nThank you, Jimmie.He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three\\nmen the plan of action.\\nTHE WOLF\\nOkay first thing, you two.\\n(meaning Jules and Vincent)\\nTake the body, stick it in the trunk. Now\\nJimmie, this looks to be a pretty\\ndomesticated house. That would lead me to\\nbelieve that in the garage or under the\\nsink, you got a bunch of cleaners and\\ncleaners and shit like that, am I correct?\\nJIMMIE\\nYeah. Exactly. Under the sink.\\nTHE WOLF\\nGood. What I need you two fellas to do is\\ntake those cleaning products and clean the\\ninside of the car. And I\\'m talkin\\' fast,\\nfast, fast. You need to go in the\\nbackseat, scoop up all those little pieces\\nof brain and skull. Get it out of there.\\nWipe down the upholstery – now when it\\ncomes to upholstery, it don\\'t need to be\\nspic and span, you don\\'t need to eat off\\nin. Give it a good once over. What you\\nneed to take care of are the really messy\\nparts. The pools of blood that have\\ncollected, you gotta soak that shit up.\\nBut the windows are a different story.\\nThem you really clean. Get the Windex, do\\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid\\nyour linen closet. I need blankets, I need\\ncomforters, I need quilts, I need\\nbedspreads. The thicker the better, the\\ndarker the better. No whites, can\\'t use\\n\\'em. We need to camouflage the interior of\\nthe car. We\\'re gonna line the front seat\\nand the backseat and the floor boards with\\nquilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and\\nstarts stickin\\' his big snout in the car,\\nthe subterfuge won\\'t last. But at a\\nglance, the car will appear to be normal.\\nJimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.\\nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent\\nand Jules standing in the kitchen.\\nVINCENT\\n(calling after him)\\nA \"please\" would be nice.\\nThe Wolf stops and turns around.\\nTHE WOLF\\nCome again?\\nVINCENT\\nI said a \"please\" would be nice.The Wolf takes a step toward him.\\nTHE WOLF\\nSet is straight, Buster. I\\'m not here to\\nsay \"please.\"I\\'m here to tell you want to\\ndo. And if self-preservation is an\\ninstinct you possess, you better fuckin\\'\\ndo it and do it quick. I\\'m here to help.\\nIf my help\\'s not appreciated, lotsa luck\\ngentlemen.\\nJULES\\nIt ain\\'t that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is\\ndefinitely appreciated.\\nVINCENT\\nI don\\'t mean any disrespect. I just don\\'t\\nlike people barkin\\' orders at me.\\nTHE WOLF\\nIf I\\'m curt with you, it\\'s because time is\\na factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I\\nneed you guys to act fast if you want to\\nget out of this. So pretty please, with\\nsugar on top, clean the fuckin\\' car.\\nINT. JIMMIE\\'S BEDROOM – MORNING\\nJimmie\\'s gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has.\\nThe Wolf is on the phone.\\nTHE WOLF\\n(into phone)\\nIt\\'s a 1974 Chevy Nova.\\n(pause)\\nWhite.\\n(pause)\\nNothin\\', except for the mess inside.\\n(pause)\\nAbout twenty minutes.\\n(pause)\\nNobody who\\'ll be missed.\\n(pause)\\nYou\\'re a good man, Joe.

I\\nwant to help you guys out and all, but\\nthat\\'s my best linen. It was a wedding\\npresent from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt\\nGinny, and they ain\\'t with us anymore –\\nTHE WOLF\\n– let me ask you a question, if you don\\'t\\nmind?\\nJIMMIE\\nSure.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWere you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\\nmillionaires?\\nJIMMIE\\nNo.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWell, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I\\'m\\npositive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny\\nwere millionaires, they would\\'ve furnished\\nyou with a whole bedroom set, which your\\nUncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.\\n(takes out a roll of bills)\\nI like oak myself, that\\'s what\\'s in my\\nbedroom. How \\'bout you Jimmie, you an oak\\nman?\\nJIMMIE\\nOak\\'s nice.\\nINT. GARAGE – MORNING\\nBoth Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent\\nis in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the\\nbackseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain.\\nBoth are twice as bloody as they were before.\\nJULES\\nI will never forgive your ass for this\\nshit. This is some fucked-up repugnant\\nshit!\\nVINCENT\\nDid you ever hear the philosophy that once\\na man admits he\\'s wrong, he\\'s immediately\\nforgiven for all wrong-doings?\\nJULES\\nMan, get outta my face with that shit! The\\nmotherfucker who said that never had to\\npick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with\\nhis fingers on account of your dumb ass.VINCENT\\nI got a threshold, Jules. I got a\\nthreshold for the abuse I\\'ll take. And\\nyou\\'re crossin\\' it. I\\'m a race car and you\\ngot me in the red. Redline 7000, that\\'s\\nwhere you are. Just know, it\\'s fuckin\\'\\ndangerous to be drivin\\' a race car when\\nit\\'s in the red. It could blow.\\nJULES\\nYou\\'re gettin\\' ready to blow? I\\'m a\\nmushroom-cloud-layin\\' motherfucker! Every\\ntime my fingers touch brain I\\'m \"SUPERFLY\\nT.N.T,\" I\\'m the \"GUNS OF NAVARONE.\" I\\'m\\nwhat Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In\\nfact, what the fuck am I doin\\' in the\\nback?

CHEVY NOVA – MORNING\\nThe interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads\\nand quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable\\nslaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle.\\nThe Wolf circles the car examining it.\\nJules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a\\nbloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job\\nthey\\'ve done.\\nTHE WOLF\\nFine job, gentlemen. We may get out of\\nthis yet.\\nJIMMIE\\nI can\\'t believe that\\'s the same car.\\nTHE WOLF\\nWell, let\\'s not start suckin\\' each other\\'s\\ndicks quite yet.

COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big\\nstack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules,\\non the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems\\nfar away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men,\\nVINCENT\\nThanks a bunch.\\n(to Jules, who\\'s nursing his coffee)\\nWant a sausage?\\nJULES\\nNaw, I don\\'t eat pork.\\nVINCENT\\nAre you Jewish?\\nJULES\\nI ain\\'t Jewish man, I just don\\'t dig on\\nswine.\\nVINCENT\\nWhy not?\\nJULES\\nThey\\'re filthy animals. I don\\'t eat filthy\\nanimals.\\nVINCENT\\nSausages taste good. Pork chops taste\\ngood.JULES\\nA sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.\\nI\\'ll never know \\'cause even if it did, I\\nwouldn\\'t eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs\\nsleep and root in shit. That\\'s a filthy\\nanimal. I don\\'t wanna eat nothin\\' that\\nain\\'t got enough sense to disregard its\\nown feces.\\nVINCENT\\nHow about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t eat dog either.\\nVINCENT\\nYes, but do you consider a dog to be a\\nfilthy animal?\\nJULES\\nI wouldn\\'t go so far as to call a dog\\nfilthy, but they\\'re definitely dirty. But\\na dog\\'s got personality. And  personality\\ngoes a long way.\\nVINCENT\\nSo by that rationale, if a pig had a\\nbetter personality, he\\'s cease to be a\\nfilthy animal?\\nJULES\\nWe\\'d have to be talkin\\' \\'bout one\\nmotherfuckin\\' charmin\\' pig. It\\'d have to\\nbe the Cary Grant of pigs.\\nThe two men laugh.\\nVINCENT\\nGood for you. Lighten up a little. You\\nbeen sittin\\' there all quiet.\\nJULES\\nI just been sittin\\' here thinkin\\'.\\nVINCENT\\n(mouthful of food)\\nAbout what?\\nJULES\\nThe miracle we witnessed.\\nVINCENT\\nThe miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a\\nfreak occurrence.\\nJULES\\nDo you know that a miracle is?\\nVINCENT\\nAn act of God.JULES\\nWhat\\'s an act of God?\\nVINCENT\\nI guess it\\'s when God makes the impossible\\npossible. And I\\'m sorry Jules, but I don\\'t\\nthink what happened this morning\\nqualifies.\\nJULES\\nDon\\'t you see, Vince, that shit don\\'t\\nmatter. You\\'re judging this thing the\\nwrong way. It\\'s not about what. It could\\nbe God stopped the bullets, he changed\\nCoke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin\\' car\\nkeys. You don\\'t judge shit like this based\\non merit. Whether or not what we\\nexperienced was an according-to-Hoyle\\nmiracle is insignificant. What is\\nsignificant is I felt God\\'s touch, God got\\ninvolved.\\nVINCENT\\nBut why?\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s what\\'s fuckin\\' wit\\' me! I don\\'t\\nknow why. But I can\\'t go back to sleep.\\nVINCENT\\nSo you\\'re serious, you\\'re really gonna\\nquit?\\nJULES\\nThe life, most definitely.\\nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the\\nb.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\\nPATRON\\nGarcon! Coffee!\\nWe recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene of\\nPumpkin and Honey Bunny.\\nVINCENT\\nSo if you\\'re quitting the life, what\\'ll\\nyou do?\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s what I\\'ve been sitting here\\ncontemplating. First, I\\'m gonna deliver\\nthis case to Marsellus. Then, basically,\\nI\\'m gonna walk the earth.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat do you mean, walk the earth?JULES\\nYou know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\" Just\\nwalk from town to town, meet people, get\\nin adventures.\\nVINCENT\\nHow long do you intend to walk the earth?\\nJULES\\nUntil God puts me where he want me to be.\\nVINCENT\\nWhat if he never does?\\nJULES\\nIf it takes forever, I\\'ll wait forever.\\nVINCENT\\nSo you decided to be a bum?\\nJULES\\nI\\'ll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no\\nless.\\nVINCENT\\nNo Jules, you\\'re gonna be like those\\npieces of shit out there who beg for\\nchange. They walk around like a bunch of\\nfuckin\\' zombies, they sleep in garbage\\nbins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs\\npiss on \\'em. They got a word for \\'em,\\nthey\\'re called bums. And without a job,\\nresidence, or legal tender, that\\'s what\\nyou\\'re gonna be – a fuckin\\' bum!\\nJULES\\nLook my friend, this is just where me and\\nyou differ –\\nVINCENT\\n– what happened was peculiar – no doubt\\nabout it – but it wasn\\'t water into wine.\\nJULES\\nAll shapes and sizes, Vince.\\nVINCENT\\nStop fuckin\\' talkin\\' like that!\\nJULES\\nIf you find my answers frightening,\\nVincent, you should cease askin\\' scary\\nquestions.\\nVINCENT\\nI gotta take a shit. To be continued.Vincent exitsfor the restroom.\\nJules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and\\nHoney Bunny rise with guns raised.\\nPUMPKIN\\nEverybody be cool, this is a robbery!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nAny of you fuckin\\' pricks move and I\\'ll\\nexecute every one of you motherfuckers!\\nGot that?!\\nJules looks up, not believing what he\\'s seeing. Under the table,\\nJules\\' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it out, COCKING\\nIT.\\nPUMPKIN\\nCustomers stay seated, waitresses on the\\nfloor.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nNow mean fuckin\\' now! Do it or die, do it\\nor fucking die!\\nLike lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While Honey\\nBunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them terrified.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!\\nAsta luego!\\nThree COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOn the floor or I\\'ll cook you ass,\\ncomprende?\\nThey comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.\\nMANAGER\\nI\\'m the manager here, there\\'s no problem,\\nno problem at all –\\nPumpkin head his way.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou\\'re gonna give me a problem?\\nHe reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the\\nManager\\'s neck.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat? You said you\\'re gonna give me a\\nproblem?\\nMANAGER\\nNo, I\\'m not. I\\'m not gonna give you any\\nproblem!PUMPKIN\\nI don\\'t know, Honey Bunny. He looks like\\nthe hero type to me!\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nDon\\'t take any chances. Execute him!\\nThe Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his hand\\ntightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.\\nMANAGER\\nPlease don\\'t! I\\'m not a hero. I\\'m just a\\ncoffee shop manager. Take anything you\\nwant.\\nPUMPKIN\\nTell everyone to cooperate and it\\'ll be\\nall over.\\nMANAGER\\nEverybody just be calm and cooperate with\\nthem and this will be all over soon!\\nPUMPKIN\\nWell done, now git your fuckin\\' ass on the\\nground.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING\\nVincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,\\nreads his \"MODESTY BLAISE\" book.\\nINT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING\\nCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till\\nin his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag\\nin his hand.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOkay people, I\\'m going to go \\'round and\\ncollect your wallets. Don\\'t talk, just\\ntoss \\'em in the bag. We clear?\\nPumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45\\nready to spit under the table.\\nPumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,\\nbriefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more\\nrespectful, him manner more on guard.\\nPUMPKIN\\nIn the bag.\\nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,\\nPumpkin points to the briefcase.\\nPUMPKIN\\nWhat\\'s in that?JULES\\nMy boss\\' dirty laundry.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou boss makes you do his laundry?\\nJULES\\nWhen he wants it clean.\\nPUMPKIN\\nSounds like a shit job.\\nJULES\\nFunny, I\\'ve been thinkin\\' the same thing.\\nPUMPKIN\\nOpen it up.\\nJules\\' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.\\nJULES\\n\\'Fraid I can\\'t do that.\\nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun\\nright in the middle of Jules\\' face and pulls back the hammer.\\nPUMPKIN\\nI didn\\'t hear you.\\nJULES\\nYes, you did.\\nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but\\nHoney Bunny senses something\\'s wrong.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nWhat\\'s goin\\' on?\\nPUMPKIN\\nLooks like we got a vigilante in our\\nmidst.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nShoot \\'em in the face!\\nJULES\\nI don\\'t mean to shatter your ego, but this\\nain\\'t the first time I\\'ve had gun pointed\\nat me.\\nPUMPKIN\\nYou don\\'t open up that case, it\\'s gonna be\\nthe last.\\nMANAGER\\n(on the ground)\\nQuit causing problems, you\\'ll get us all\\nkilled!

The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin\\'s\\nexpression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can\\'t\\nsee shit.\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nWhat is it? What is it?\\nPUMPKIN\\n(softly)\\nIs that what I think it is?\\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nPUMPKIN\\nIt\\'s beautiful.\\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\\nHONEY BUNNY\\nGoddammit, what is it?\\nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the\\ncase to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the\\ncase.\\nLike a rattlesnake, Jules\\' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin\\'s\\ngun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from\\nunder the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under\\nPumpkin\\'s chin.\\nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving his gun in Jules\\' direction.HONEY BUNNY\\nLet him go!

Now I\\ndon\\'t want that and you don\\'t want that\\nand Ringo here don\\'t want that. So let\\'s\\nsee what we can do.\\n(to Ringo)\\nNow this is the situation. Normally both\\nof your asses would be dead as fuckin\\'\\nfried chicken. But you  appened to pull\\nthis shit while I\\'m in a transitional\\nperiod. I don\\'t wanna kill ya, I want to\\nhelp ya.

For he is\\ntruly his brother\\'s keeper and the finder\\nof lost children. And I will strike down\\nupon thee with great vengeance and furious\\nanger those who attempt to poison and\\ndestroy my brothers. And you will know I\\nam the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon\\nyou.\"I been sayin\\' that shit for years.\\nAnd if you ever heard it, it meant your\\nass. I never really questioned what it\\nmeant. I thought it was just a cold-\\nblooded thing to say to a motherfucker\\n\\'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I\\nsaw some shit this mornin\\' made me think\\ntwice. Now I\\'m thinkin\\', it could mean\\nyou\\'re the evil man. And I\\'m the righteous\\nman. And Mr. .45 here, he\\'s the shepherd\\nprotecting my righteous ass in the valley\\nof darkness. Or is could by you\\'re the\\nrighteous man and I\\'m the shepherd and\\nit\\'s the world that\\'s evil and selfish.\\n(MORE)JULES (CONT\\'D)\\nI\\'d like that. But that shit ain\\'t the\\ntruth. The truth is you\\'re the weak. And\\nI\\'m the tyranny of evil men. But I\\'m\\ntryin\\'. I\\'m tryin\\' real hard to be a\\nshepherd.\\nJules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.\\nPumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to Yolanda.\\nShe looks back.\\nGrabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the door.\\nJules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a\\nsip of coffee.\\nJULES\\n(to himself)\\nIt\\'s cold.\\nHe pushes it aside.\\nVincent appears next to Jules.\\nVINCENT\\nI think we oughta leave now.\\nJULES\\nThat\\'s probably a good idea.\\nVincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the\\nbriefcase.\\nThen, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the Cooks,\\nthe Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes – wearing\\nUC Santa Cruz and \"I\\'m with Stupid\" tee-shirts, swim trunks,\\nthongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of the coffee shop\\ntogether without saying a word.\\nFADE OUT\\nTHE END'"
